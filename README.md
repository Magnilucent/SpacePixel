SpacePixel
==========

SpacePixel is based off a game I played years ago that I've forgotten the name of. In SpacePixel you control a 1 pixel large spaceship and face off against large numbers of other 1 pixel large spaceships. There are two weapons: rockets and homing missles. Both are 1 pixel large and it is really difficult to hit targets with the rockets, though you can fire them almost every click of the mouse. Homing rockets make things easier but they hasve a much slower fire rate.

Current state: Player is all alone in the world. No weapon sysetm.

Controls:

W/S: Adjust speed

A/D: Turn
